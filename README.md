Crave on Campus is an app that functions as an on-campus food delivery services who drivers are students of the university and whose customers are student, faculty and staff of the university. The app function acts similarly like GrubHub and DoorDash, however it’s campus controlled. Our team’s scope is to add a rating systems to the database, to control and track ratings of restaurants and delivery drivers. To start we will be using a database that is on loan from “Mavericks” from UNC Charlotte (Dhananjay Arora, AkshayBabu, Sumit Kawale and Prashant Madaan).

## Use Case for Rating Systems

Student, Faculty and Staff can register as customers and log in to the Crave app and search for restaurants. They can order food and choose the time of delivery. The customers may be interested in the rating of restaurants when choosing where to place their order. The order is assigned to the driver. After the order is complete, the customer is prompted to insert a one rating per order, although it is not required. The Administrator can log in to view ratings of restaurant and drivers.
